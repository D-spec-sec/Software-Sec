### Waterfall
The Waterfall model is a traditional and sequential project management approach. In Waterfall, the entire project is divided into distinct phases, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. 
It is a rigid approach where all the requirements are gathered and defined upfront before the project starts. Changes to requirements are generally not allowed once the project is underway.

### Hybrid
Hybrid refers to a combination of different project management methodologies. It allows for flexibility in choosing and combining elements from various approaches like Waterfall and Agile.

### Scrum
Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on iterative and incremental development. Scrum is more flexible than Waterfall, and it doesn't require all requirements to be known upfront. It allows for changes and adaptations during the development process.

### Kanban
Kanban is another Agile methodology that emphasizes continuous delivery and flow. It is not a rigid approach and allows for changes and adjustments as needed. Kanban is more about visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow.

### RAD
Rapid Application Development (RAD) focuses on quickly building and delivering software by prioritizing rapid prototyping and iteration. It emphasizes delivering a subset of functionality quickly to meet immediate needs

### Fagan  
Fagan Inspections involve a formalized, structured approach to reviewing software artifacts to identify defects early in the development process. It includes roles such as moderator, author, reviewer, and scribe, and follows specific entry and exit criteria.

### Spiral 
The Spiral Method combines elements of the waterfall model with iterative development and incorporates risk management principles. It involves multiple iterations of planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements and risks.

### Build and Fix
"Build and Fix (or ad hoc)," describes a model where developers quickly build a software product without much planning or formal processes, then make modifications based on feedback or issues encountered. However, this approach often leads to unpredictable results and can result in poor-quality software.

### XP
XP (extreme programming) emphasizes continuous testing, frequent releases, and pair programming, but it doesn't specifically involve delivering an initial product and then iteratively modifying it based on customer feedback.
