The Waterfall model is a traditional and sequential project management approach. In Waterfall, the entire project is divided into distinct phases, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. 
It is a rigid approach where all the requirements are gathered and defined upfront before the project starts. Changes to requirements are generally not allowed once the project is underway.

Hybrid: Hybrid refers to a combination of different project management methodologies. It allows for flexibility in choosing and combining elements from various approaches like Waterfall and Agile.

Scrum: Scrum is an Agile framework that focuses on iterative and incremental development. Scrum is more flexible than Waterfall, and it doesn't require all requirements to be known upfront. It allows for changes and adaptations during the development process.

Kanban: Kanban is another Agile methodology that emphasizes continuous delivery and flow. It is not a rigid approach and allows for changes and adjustments as needed. Kanban is more about visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing flow.
