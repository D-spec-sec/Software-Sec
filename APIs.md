### There are two major types of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) based on their communication styles and use cases:



RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer):

REST is an architectural style that uses a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP.

RESTful APIs are designed to be simple and scalable, making use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.

They often return data in commonly understood formats, such as JSON or XML.



SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol):

SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services.

SOAP APIs use XML as their message format and can be transported over various protocols, including HTTP and SMTP.

They are known for their strict standards and can offer features like security and transaction support.
