### High Cohesion
High cohesion means that the elements within a module or component are closely related and work together to achieve a common goal. This helps in creating more maintainable and understandable code.

### Low Coupling
Low coupling means that the components of a system are loosely connected, and changes in one component are less likely to affect others. Low coupling promotes flexibility and ease of maintenance.
