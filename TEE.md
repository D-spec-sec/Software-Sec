The TEE is a secure processing environment but is not a feature intrinsic to the TPM itself. Instead, the TEE relies on the TPM to establish a chain of trust to the device hardware, facilitating the creation of a trusted software environment. 
This aligns with the typical role of the TPM in providing a foundation for secure operations and trust in computing systems.

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure processing environment that is not a feature inherent to the TPM. However, it depends on the TPM to establish a chain of trust to the device hardware, enabling the creation of a trusted software environment.
