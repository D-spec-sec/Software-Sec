### Fuzzing 
Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, involves providing the software with a large amount of random or unexpected inputs to discover vulnerabilities. It helps identify how the software handles unexpected data and can reveal security weaknesses, such as buffer overflows or input validation issues.

### SAST
Analyzing code without execution (SAST): Static Application Security Testing (SAST) involves analyzing the source code, bytecode, or binary code of an application without executing it. SAST is useful for finding vulnerabilities in the code itself but does not involve running the software with random inputs.

### Synthetic transactions
Synthetic transactions typically refer to simulated interactions with a system to monitor its performance, rather than specifically testing for vulnerabilities. It is not a technique focused on exposing software to extensive random inputs for security testing.
Synthetic transactions involve simulating user interactions with the web application to monitor its performance and functionality. By creating automated scripts that mimic real user behavior, John can evaluate the application's response time, availability, and functionality of new features that are infrequently used. This technique allows John to proactively identify performance issues and ensure a positive user experience without relying solely on user-reported issues.

### Unit testing
Unit testing focuses on verifying the correctness of individual units or components of code. While important in the development process, unit testing may not be sufficient for evaluating the overall performance and user experience of a web application, especially after an upgrade.
Unit testing is a software testing technique that focuses on testing individual components or units of code to ensure they function correctly. While unit testing is essential for verifying the functionality of specific code modules, it may not be suitable for evaluating the overall performance of a web application, especially in terms of profitability of new features. Unit testing primarily focuses on code quality and functionality rather than user experience and performance.
