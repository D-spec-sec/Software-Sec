### Fuzzing 
Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, involves providing the software with a large amount of random or unexpected inputs to discover vulnerabilities. It helps identify how the software handles unexpected data and can reveal security weaknesses, such as buffer overflows or input validation issues.

### SAST
Analyzing code without execution (SAST): Static Application Security Testing (SAST) involves analyzing the source code, bytecode, or binary code of an application without executing it. SAST is useful for finding vulnerabilities in the code itself but does not involve running the software with random inputs.

### Synthetic transactions
Synthetic transactions typically refer to simulated interactions with a system to monitor its performance, rather than specifically testing for vulnerabilities. It is not a technique focused on exposing software to extensive random inputs for security testing.

### Unit testing
Unit testing focuses on verifying the correctness of individual units or components of code. While important in the development process, unit testing may not be sufficient for evaluating the overall performance and user experience of a web application, especially after an upgrade.
