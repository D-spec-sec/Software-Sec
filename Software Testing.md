Fuzz testing, also known as fuzzing, involves providing the software with a large amount of random or unexpected inputs to discover vulnerabilities. It helps identify how the software handles unexpected data and can reveal security weaknesses, such as buffer overflows or input validation issues.

Analyzing code without execution (SAST): Static Application Security Testing (SAST) involves analyzing the source code, bytecode, or binary code of an application without executing it. SAST is useful for finding vulnerabilities in the code itself but does not involve running the software with random inputs.

Manual penetration testing: Manual penetration testing involves human testers actively attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in a system. While this can be an effective method, it is not specifically focused on subjecting the software to extensive random inputs.

Synthetic transactions: Synthetic transactions typically refer to simulated interactions with a system to monitor its performance, rather than specifically testing for vulnerabilities. It is not a technique focused on exposing software to extensive random inputs for security testing.
